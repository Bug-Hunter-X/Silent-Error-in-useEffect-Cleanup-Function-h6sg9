This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error is swallowed and not displayed in the console, making it difficult to debug.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someFunctionThatReturnsASubscription();

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw an error if the subscription is already unsubscribed or null
  };
}, []);
```
