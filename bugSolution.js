The solution involves adding a `try...catch` block inside the cleanup function to catch and log any errors.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someFunctionThatReturnsASubscription();

  return () => {
    try {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error in useEffect cleanup:', error);
    }
  };
}, []);
```
This improvement ensures that any exceptions during the unsubscription process are reported, simplifying debugging considerably.
